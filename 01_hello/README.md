# 01: Hello

This is my first time writing Zig so I decided to start out at the very
beginning with a basic "Hello world!" program.

One thing I've immediately noticed about Zig is the `try` keyword and `!`
operator which remind me of the Rust `?` operator and `Result<T, E>` type. My
first impressions is that I kinda prefer the explicit-ness of `Result<T, E>`
and the ability to include `?` as part of a call chains, but maybe the Zig way
will grow on me over time.
